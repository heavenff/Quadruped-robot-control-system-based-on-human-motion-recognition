# Quadruped-robot-control-system-based-on-human-motion-recognition
the designed human activity recognition algorithm and the quadruped robot control system based on human activity recognition are experimentally verified. First, the accuracy of human activity recognition is verified. It can be seen from the experimental results that the designed algorithm can accurately read the coordinates of multiple joints and recognize 4 human actions according to the threshold, with an average recognition accuracy rate of 98.9%; secondly, can the control system allow the quadruped robot to effectively schedule the corresponding tasks according to the human activities, and the success rate of the control Verified. According to the experimental results, human actions can successfully control the robot to perform the corresponding actions, and the average control success rate is 97.0%.
